<p class="el_center">The theme for my dataset will be the rock band Imagine Dragons.
The data relating to my theme has partially been collected. 
The band's website contains information about their albums and songs, 
also the lyrics to their songs and the music videos. However, it does not contain sheet music as a form of notated data. 
The data is simply curated and presented to the user, it is not analysed.</p>
