<h2>Week 1 Project Description</h2>
<p>The theme for my dataset will be the rock band Imagine Dragons.
The data relating to my theme has partially been collected. 
The band's <a href="https://www.imaginedragonsmusic.com">website</a> contains information about their albums and songs, 
also the lyrics to their songs and the music videos. However, it does not contain sheet music as a form of notated data. 
The data is simply curated and presented to the user, it is not analysed.</p>
